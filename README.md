# Questia

Questia is a classroom management and assessment platform designed to empower teachers and students through AI-driven tools. Teachers can create classrooms, generate assignments with AI assistance, and provide instant feedback to students, while students can seamlessly access and review their assignments in a structured, interactive environment.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for Questia stems from the need for a streamlined, technology-driven solution to classroom management and student assessments. We wanted to make the process of creating, assigning, and grading assignments easier for teachers while also providing constructive feedback to students instantly. With the advancements in AI, we saw an opportunity to bridge the gap between traditional teaching methods and modern educational tools.

## How It Works

### For Teachers:
- **Classroom Creation:** Teachers can log into their dashboard and create a classroom, which generates a unique code.
- **Student Enrollment:** Students join the classroom using the unique code.
- **Assignment Creation:** Teachers can create assignments (with a choice of level hardness, number of multiple-choice and subjective questions and the grade level of questions) with the help of AI assistance.
- **Assignment Editing:** Teachers can then edit the assignment if they are not satisfied before assigning it to the students.
- **Assignment Assignment:** Assign assignments to specific classrooms with just a few clicks.
- **Review Answers:** Teachers can view students' answers and track their progress.

### For Students:
- **Join Classrooms:** Students log into their dashboard and join classrooms using the provided code.
- **Access Assignments:** Access assignments assigned to them in specific classrooms.
- **Instant Feedback:** Submit answers and receive constructive feedback powered by AI instantly, even for subjective questions.
- **Review:** Revisit their answers, correct solutions, and feedback on a dedicated review page.
